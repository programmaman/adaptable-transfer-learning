# Automated Transfer Learning Graph Model

## Introduction
In this project, we propose an automated transfer learning graph model.

## Methodology

We'll use Dead Nodes to learn the underlying structure of the graph.




### Deep Learning Graph Construction
We will build a deep learning graph, then take multiple inputs and outputs to construct a neural network.

### Neural Network Utilization
Subsequently, we will build another graph using the same neural network.

## Conclusion
This approach aims to leverage transfer learning to improve the efficiency and performance of neural network models.





Hopefully easily applyable to downstream tasks with less training

Research question, does utilizing Graph structural properties subsume transfer learning tasks





Try to build a loss function that has a high value when the model is wromg



Future work: Multi Loss Model that uses each possible task loss seperately and combines them when they show overlap
